###
Takes a list of arity-1, mutation functions and their corresponding
probabilities, the maximum number of mutations to generate, an arity-0 function
for generating random numbers between 0 and 1, and a target to apply mutations
to, and returns the target, transformed according to a (pseudo-)random series of
mutations.
